# UTF8 Utils

This library provides a means of cleaning UTF8 strings with invalid characters.

It provides functionality that replaces [ActiveSupport's `tidy_bytes`
method](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Multibyte/Chars.html#M000977),
with a faster algorithm that works on 1.8.6 - 1.9.x.

I will be sending this as a patch to ActiveSupport; in the mean time you can
access at [its home on Github](github.com/norman/utf8_utils).

## The Problem

Here's what happens when you try to access a string with invalid UTF-8 characters in Ruby 1.9:

    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > "my messed up \x92 string".split(//u)
    ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8
            from (irb):3:in `split'
            from (irb):3
            from /Users/norman/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.1-p378/bin/irb:17:in `<main>'

## The Solution

    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > "my messed up \x92 string".tidy_bytes.split(//u)
     => ["m", "y", " ", "m", "e", "s", "s", "e", "d", " ", "u", "p", " ", "â€™", " ", "s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g"]

Note that like ActiveSupport, it naively assumes if you have invalid UTF8
characters, they are either Windows CP1251 or ISO8859-1. In practice this isn't
a bad assumption, but may not always work.

This library's `tidy_bytes` method is a little less than twice as fast as the
one provided by ActiveSupport:

                               | ACTIVE_SUPPORT | UTF8_UTILS |
    ----------------------------------------------------------
    tidy bytes          x20000 |          1.008 |      0.650 |
    ==========================================================
    Total                      |          1.008 |      0.650 |


## Getting it

    gem install utf8_utils


## Using it

    # encoding: utf-8
    require "utf8_utils"

    # tidy bytes
    good_string = bad_string.tidy_bytes

    # tidy bytes in-place
    string.tidy_bytes!
