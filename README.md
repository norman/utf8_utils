# UTF8 Utils

This library provides a means of cleaning UTF8 strings with invalid characters.

It provides functionality very similar to [ActiveSupport's `tidy_bytes`
method](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Multibyte/Chars.html#M000977),
but works for Ruby 1.8.6 - 1.9.x. Once I sort out any potentially embarrassing
issues with it, I'll probably try patching it into ActiveSupport.

## The Problem

Here's what happens when you try to access a string with invalid UTF-8 characters in Ruby 1.9:

    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > "my messed up \x92 string".split(//)
    ArgumentError: invalid byte sequence in UTF-8
            from (irb):3:in `split'
            from (irb):3
            from /Users/norman/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.1-p378/bin/irb:17:in `<main>'

## The Solution

    ruby-1.9.1-p378 > "my messed up \x92 string".to_utf8_codepoints.tidy_bytes.to_s.split(//u)
     => ["m", "y", " ", "m", "e", "s", "s", "e", "d", " ", "u", "p", " ", "â€™", " ", "s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g"]

Amazing in its brevity and elegance, huh? Ok, maybe not really but if you have
some badly encoded data you need to clean up, it can save you from ripping out
your hair.

Note that like ActiveSupport, it naively assumes if you have invalid UTF8
characters, they are either Windows CP1251 or ISO8859-1. In practice this isn't
a bad assumption, but may not always work.

## Getting it

    gem install utf8_utils


## Using it

    require "utf8_utils"

    # Traverse codepoints
    "hello-world".to_utf8_codepoints.each_codepoint do |codepoint|
        puts codepoint.valid?
     end

     # tidy bytes
     good_string = bad_string.to_utf8_codepoints.tidy_bytes.to_s
